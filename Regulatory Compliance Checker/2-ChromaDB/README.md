**Contract Data Processing and Embedding Storage**

This Python script processes contract data from a CSV file (Dataset.csv), generates text embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from SentenceTransformers, and stores the data in a ChromaDB collection. The script reads the contract dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and extracts relevant fields such as category, agreement date, contract text, exact law, and description. It then encodes the contract text into vector embeddings, which are added to ChromaDB along with metadata for efficient retrieval. Additionally, the processed data, including formatted text descriptions and embeddings, is saved as embeddings.json in a structured format. This setup enables efficient contract retrieval, similarity search, and legal text analysis using vector-based search.
