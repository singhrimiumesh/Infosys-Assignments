If, because of an act of God, inevitable accident, fire,\n                  lockout, strike or other labor dispute, riot or civil\n                  commotion, act of public enemy, enactment, rule, order or act\n                  of any government or governmental instrumentality (whether\n                  federal, state, local or foreign), failure of technical\n                  facilities, failure or delay of transportation facilities,\n                  illness or incapacity of any performer or producer, or other\n                  cause of a similar or\n                                       6\n   9\n                  different nature not reasonably within either party's control,\n                  such party is materially hampered in the recording,\n                  manufacture, distribution or sale of phonograph records, or\n                  its normal business operations become commercially\n                  impractical, then without limiting its rights, it will have\n                  the option upon notice to suspend the Term of this Agreement\n                  for the duration of any such contingency. In the event of a\n                  suspension owing to a \"force majeure,\" which suspension\n                  exceeds six (6) consecutive months, the non-suspending party\n                  may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice\n                  to other, but only if such \"force majeure\" does not affect a\n                  substantial portion of the United States recording industry or\n                  the suspension is not lifted by the suspending party within\n                  ten (10) days of the receipt of the written notice from the\n                  other party.\n10.      Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party\n         and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of\n         action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including\n         legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any\n         claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the\n         warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the\n         indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the\n         determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the\n         non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to\n         withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in\n         an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its\n         estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'\n         fees) in connection therewith.\n11.      Notices. The respective addresses for each party for all purposes\n         hereunder are set forth on page 1 hereof, unless and until notice of a\n         different address is received by the party being notified of a change\n         of address. All notices will be in writing and will either be served by\n         personal delivery (to an officer of each company), by mail or by\n         telegraph, in each case with all charges prepaid. Notices will be\n         deemed effective when personally delivered, mailed certified mail or\n         similar delivery requiring a signature upon delivery, all charges\n         prepaid, except for notice of change of address, which will be\n         effective only when received by the party notified.

The failure to send courtesy copies of notices will not be\n         deemed a breach of this Agreement nor will it diminish the\n         effectiveness of such notice.\n12.      Assignment. Either party may, at its election, assign this Agreement or\n         any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in\n         whole or in part, to any person, firm or corporation owning or\n         acquiring all or a substantial portion of its assets, to any person,\n         firm or corporation that is related to it as an affiliate,\n                                       7\n   10\n         subsidiary or otherwise, or to any person, firm or corporation into\n         which or with it might merge or consolidate.

The prevailing party in any such\n                  dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the\n                  other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection\n                  therewith in addition to the costs thereof.\n         c.       If any part of this Agreement will be determined to be invalid\n                  or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or by\n                  any other legally constituted body having jurisdiction to make\n                  such determination, the remainder of this Agreement will\n                  remain in full force and effect.\n         d.

Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the\nmerchandise along with email address of the other party.\n2.

Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the\nbuyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means.\n4.   i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting\nthem to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer.\n5.   The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment.\n6.

Bizzingo will acquire basic business  information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business \nname and address,  telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with \nspecific  groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  \ninformation, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information  for a \nspecific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective  user (\u201cSeeded Profile \u201d). As of \nthe date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers  and associations to provide the basic business information for over \n6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo.  For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an \n\u201cActivated User. \u201d \n\u00a0 \n(b). In order to activate a  Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the \nNetwork,  and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim  the Seeded \nProfile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence  has been completed by a \nuser, that user will be deemed to be an \u201cActivated User \u201d\u00a0and the Network will identify that  user as an Activated User.  \n\u00a0 \nMethod  2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will  be deemed an \nActivated User and the Network will identify that user as an \u201cActivated User. \u201d \n\u00a0 \nII \nRoyalty  and Initial Bonus  \n\u00a0 \n1. Royalty . The Royalty  payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further \ndescribed herein)  for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty \nPeriod  during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per  Activated \nUser, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and  1,500,000 Activated Users, \nrespectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty  Period and an additional 1,000,000 common \nstock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant  shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of \ncommon stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term  of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The \nform of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A -l and  shall be referred to as the \u201cRoyalty Warrant .\" \n\u00a0 \u00a0\n9\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\u00a0 \n2. Initial Bonus . Concurrent  with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to \npurchase 1,000,000  shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant  is \nattached hereto as Schedule A -II and shall be referred to as the \u201cBonus Warrant .\" \n\u00a0 \n3. Restrictive Legend .

Bizzingo will acquire basic business  information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business \nname and address,  telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with \nspecific  groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  \ninformation, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information  for a \nspecific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective  user (\u201cSeeded Profile \u201d). As of \nthe date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers  and associations to provide the basic business information for over \n6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo.  For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an \n\u201cActivated User. \u201d \n\u00a0 \n(b). In order to activate a  Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the \nNetwork,  and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim  the Seeded \nProfile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence  has been completed by a \nuser, that user will be deemed to be an \u201cActivated User \u201d\u00a0and the Network will identify that  user as an Activated User.  \n\u00a0 \nMethod  2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will  be deemed an \nActivated User and the Network will identify that user as an \u201cActivated User. \u201d \n\u00a0 \nII \nRoyalty  and Initial Bonus  \n\u00a0 \n1. Royalty . The Royalty  payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further \ndescribed herein)  for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty \nPeriod  during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per  Activated \nUser, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and  1,500,000 Activated Users, \nrespectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty  Period and an additional 1,000,000 common \nstock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant  shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of \ncommon stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term  of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The \nform of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A -l and  shall be referred to as the \u201cRoyalty Warrant .\" \n\u00a0 \u00a0\n9\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\u00a0 \n2. Initial Bonus . Concurrent  with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to \npurchase 1,000,000  shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant  is \nattached hereto as Schedule A -II and shall be referred to as the \u201cBonus Warrant .\" \n\u00a0 \n3. Restrictive Legend .

            "Exact Law": "The law that is closest to this contract is the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which has been adopted by many states in the United States. The UTSA provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of trade secrets and confidential information.",
            "Description": "The UTSA defines a trade secret as information that is not generally known or readily ascertainable by others, and that derives economic value from being kept secret. It also provides that a trade secret may be a formula, pattern, or other type of information that is not generally known and that is used to derive economic value.\n\nThe contract at issue appears to be a celebrity endorsement agreement between Bizzingo, Inc. and Joseph Theismann. The agreement grants Theismann a royalty for each activated user of Bizzingo's network, which derives from confidential information that Bizzingo has acquired to populate its network. The agreement also includes a confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement, which is similar to those found in trade secret agreements."

PURPOSE OF APPLICATION SYSTEM.\nTo create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting\nplatform.\nThe Platform is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non-\nprofessional betting market.\nA landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices.\nDeveloper will publish the app in Apple Store / Google Play Store with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be\nuploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client.\nThe applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other\nsports betting platforms.\nThe app will be developed under the following considerations:\n\u25cf Native iOS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment.\n\u25cf Native JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+\n\u25cf Ruby On Rails Backend + PostgreSQL + Rest API\n\u25cf HTML5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap\nCore Platform\nThe Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact\nwith a platform for free in order to win real money.\nOur primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players. We target a more general demographic that is much more general and includes\nmore of the female population.\nOur games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from\npush notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 \u2013 4 times per month. Because the format doesn\u2019t change,\nwe can run games nightly for NBA to NHL, NFL to individual events such as the Oscars, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as\nSoccer and Nascar.\nGames and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. Api\u2019s Are plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual\noption to allow customs events that can be run through the platform.\nBusiness model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant\namounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are\nmore top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10.\nInitially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors\nwill pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their\nproduct/company.\n8 \u2502 Page\nSource: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/2020Eventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting.\nMonetization\nWe will initially fund the first month of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After the first month we will have enough users to\nbegin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising.\nB. SERVICES.\nThe Developer will develop the mobile application based on the Client\u2019s specifications, will assist the Client in acquiring corporate sponsors and\nwill operate and maintain the Application System through hosting of games including customer support.

PURPOSE OF APPLICATION SYSTEM.\nTo create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting\nplatform.\nThe Platform is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non-\nprofessional betting market.\nA landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices.\nDeveloper will publish the app in Apple Store / Google Play Store with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be\nuploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client.\nThe applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other\nsports betting platforms.\nThe app will be developed under the following considerations:\n\u25cf Native iOS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment.\n\u25cf Native JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+\n\u25cf Ruby On Rails Backend + PostgreSQL + Rest API\n\u25cf HTML5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap\nCore Platform\nThe Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact\nwith a platform for free in order to win real money.\nOur primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players. We target a more general demographic that is much more general and includes\nmore of the female population.\nOur games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from\npush notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 \u2013 4 times per month. Because the format doesn\u2019t change,\nwe can run games nightly for NBA to NHL, NFL to individual events such as the Oscars, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as\nSoccer and Nascar.\nGames and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. Api\u2019s Are plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual\noption to allow customs events that can be run through the platform.\nBusiness model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant\namounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are\nmore top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10.\nInitially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors\nwill pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their\nproduct/company.\n8 \u2502 Page\nSource: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/2020Eventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting.\nMonetization\nWe will initially fund the first month of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After the first month we will have enough users to\nbegin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising.\nB.

In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the\n         sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the\n         mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT\n         TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written\n         notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.\n4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo\n         nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING\n         DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by\n         mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.\n5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar\n         to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent's marks LUCENT, LUCENT\n         TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so\n         shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this\n         Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.\n6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in\n         the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the\n         subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.\n7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.\n         mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current\n         quality of their Goods.\n8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at\n         the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in\n         writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.\n9.       mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and\n         approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to\n         be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n10.      In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase\n         agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent's\n         expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third\nSource: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003         parties. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to\n         require Lucent to enforce any rights against third parties or to\n         restrict Lucent's rights to license or consent to such third parties'\n         use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or any other Lucent marks.\n11.      The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall\n         continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to\n         annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual\n         expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent\n         shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate\n         the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least\n         thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.\n12.

This Agreement shall not be assigned by mPhase without the prior\n         written consent of Lucent.\n15.

In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the\n         sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the\n         mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT\n         TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written\n         notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.\n4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo\n         nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING\n         DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by\n         mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.\n5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar\n         to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent's marks LUCENT, LUCENT\n         TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so\n         shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this\n         Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.\n6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in\n         the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the\n         subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.\n7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.\n         mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current\n         quality of their Goods.\n8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at\n         the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in\n         writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.\n9.       mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and\n         approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to\n         be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n10.      In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the\n         Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase\n         agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent's\n         expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third\nSource: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003         parties. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to\n         require Lucent to enforce any rights against third parties or to\n         restrict Lucent's rights to license or consent to such third parties'\n         use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or any other Lucent marks.\n11.      The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall\n         continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to\n         annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual\n         expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent\n         shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate\n         the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least\n         thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.\n12.      Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use\n         of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall\n         have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold\n         prior to the date of such termination.\n                                      -2-\n13.      Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or\n         consequential damages, even if such Party has been advised of the\n         possibility of such damages.\n14.      This Agreement shall not be assigned by mPhase without the prior\n         written consent of Lucent.\n15.

The only login or\nregistration that should be required to access the Service or the Co-Branded\nPages is theglobe Site 's login or registration.  Because Boxlot hosts the\nService and the Co-Branded Pages , theglobe will pass to Boxlot information about\neach User accessing the Service or the Co-Branded Pages  as described below:\n .    Accounts will be created for each User via a one-time \"welcome\" page\n     (hosted by theglobe) when the User tries to access the portion of the\n     Service requiring such registration for the first time.\n .    The \"welcome\" page will include registration fields for any information\n     about the User needed to use the Service but not currently in theglobe's\n     database.\n .    The \"welcome\" page will include a \"Privacy Policy\" informing the User that\n     their data is being passed to a third party (Boxlot) in order to use the\n     Services.\n .    Any additional required User information is collected and entered into\n     theglobe's database. Then, the required User information is sent to Boxlot\n     all at once to create the new account. theglobe will include the User's\n     \"username\" and \"UserID#\" in the data passed to Boxlot.\nAdditional notes on account creation:\n .    The User will only see the \"Welcome\" page until they consent to the privacy\n     policy and enter any required information. This page will not appear after\n     the User completes the initial account creation process.\n .    Account information stored on Boxlot's servers in connection to the Service\n     will need to be kept in parity with theglobe. To do so, the parties shall\n     work together to implement a mechanism for updating information on Boxlot's\n     servers when User information changes on theglobe Site .\n .    The technology used to pass the data to Boxlot for account creation and\n     ongoing account updates will be determined jointly by Boxlot and theglobe.\n .    The UserID# theglobe passes to Boxlot during account creation will be\n     stored by Boxlot in association with each User. This UserID# is necessary\n     to link individual user reporting and individual account updates between\n     Boxlot and theglobe on an ongoing basis.\n                                       18\nSource: THEGLOBE COM INC, S-1/A, 5/3/1999",

The User will only see the \"Welcome\" page until they consent to the privacy\n     policy and enter any required information.
