#Contract Law Extraction Script
This Python script processes a dataset containing contract data and extracts the exact law and a brief description of each contract using the Groq API. The script reads a CSV file (dataset.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring that the necessary columns (Exact Law and Description) exist. For each contract entry, it sends a request to the Groq API to analyze the contract text and retrieve relevant legal information. The API response is then parsed to extract the exact law and its description, which are added to the dataset. A rate-limiting mechanism handles API restrictions by implementing a retry mechanism when necessary. Finally, the updated dataset is saved as Dataset.csv. This automation streamlines contract analysis by leveraging AI for legal text processing.
