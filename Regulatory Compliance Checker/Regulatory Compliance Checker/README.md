**Regulatory Compliance Checker for Legal Contracts**

This **Regulatory Compliance Checker for Legal Contracts** is designed to help users analyze legal agreements by extracting key clauses and evaluating compliance, clarity, completeness, and overall quality. The tool allows users to upload contracts in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats, after which it extracts the text and processes it using an advanced AI model. Users can choose between two core functionalities: Extract Key Clauses and Analysis Report. The Extract Key Clauses feature identifies and lists important sections of the contract, while the Analysis Report provides an in-depth assessment based on legal standards, structural clarity, missing elements, and areas for improvement. The AI generates a structured JSON output, scoring the contract from 1 to 100 and offering actionable recommendations. The tool ensures ease of use with a simple file upload system and an interactive interface powered by Streamlit, making contract review more efficient and accessible.
