of recorded compilations and companion song books featuring praise and worship

therefore, the parties agree as follows:
1.       Product Concept and Creation.
         a.       Product description. The product to be created under the
                  series trade name ""Songs 4 Worship"" will be a praise and
                  worship continuity series, with each volume in the series
                  containing approximately 22 songs. Each volume will be
                  manufactured in Double CD, Double Cassette, and song book
                  formats, with standard double jewel boxes, inlays, booklets
                  and j-cards (the ""Product""). TL and Integrity will jointly
                  develop the repertoire, and all repertoire selections are
                  subject to master, mechanical and print rights clearance in
                  accordance with the financial terms established below. The
                  exact songbook format, song selection and number of songbook
                  volumes has not yet been determined, and TL has no obligation
                  to sell any songbooks produced pursuant to this Agreement.
         b.       Branding. The Product will prominently display the ""Songs 4
                  Worship"" logo and trademark (or other logo as mutually
                  approved) and will also bear the labels of ""Time Life Music""
                  and ""Integrity Music"" in equal proportion on the exterior of
                  Product packaging. The ""Integrity Music"" and ""Time Life Music""
                  logos will be used on advertising whenever possible, and it is
                  understood that neither logo will be used without the other
                  with reference to the Product.
         c.       Integrity's responsibilities. Integrity will obtain master
                  lease and print agreements with all third party owners of
                  masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical
                  rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the
                  then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not
                  exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the
                  retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the
                  Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.

                  to grant the rights herein granted by it, and to perform the

                  its normal business operations become commercially
                  impractical, then without limiting its rights, it will have
                  the option upon notice to suspend the Term of this Agreement
                  for the duration of any such contingency. In the event of a
                  suspension owing to a ""force majeure,"" which suspension
                  exceeds six (6) consecutive months, the non-suspending party

         claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the
         warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the
         indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the
         determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the
         non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to
         withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in
         an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its
         estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'
         fees) in connection therewith.

         deemed a breach of this Agreement nor will it diminish the
         effectiveness of such notice.
12.      Assignment. Either party may, at its election, assign this Agreement or
         any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in

                  dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the
                  other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection
                  therewith in addition to the costs thereof.
         c.       If any part of this Agreement will be determined to be invalid

                  any other legally constituted body having jurisdiction to make
                  such determination, the remainder of this Agreement will

information, specimens, and the like, provided and only to the extent such is reasonably necessary to prosecute the suit. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Article 7.00 shall require Investor to join any such suit as a party, and Company shall not seek to join Investor to any such
suit as a party absent the express written consent of Investor. Any recovery received pursuant to such suit will first go to Investor to reimburse

  IP Rights Agreement
 
7.01 If, after the Option is exercised before the expiration of the Option Period such that the license grants set forth in Articles 3.00 and 3.01
have become exclusive under Article 3.03, Company does not enforce the Patents, through legal action or otherwise, Investor may enforce the
Patents and Company agrees to reasonably cooperate with Investor in such suit for infringement, including requesting Company’s employees or
consultants to testify when requested by Investor in writing, making available records, papers, information, specimens, and the like, provided and
only to the extent such is reasonably necessary to prosecute the suit. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article 7.01 shall require
Company to join any such suit as a party, and Investor shall not seek to join Company to any such suit as a party absent the express written
consent of Company; provided, however, if Company elects not to give its express written consent to be joined as a party, but joinder is required in
order for Investor to file or maintain legal action to enforce any Patents, Company agrees that if requested by Investor, Company will negotiate and
enter into an amendment to this IP Agreement to the extent necessary for Investor to file or maintain legal action to enforce the Patents. Any
recovery received pursuant to such suit will first go to Company to reimburse Company for any costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
reasonably incurred by Company in cooperating with Investor in the suit, and any remaining amounts shall be retained by Investor.
 
VIII. Non-assignability
 
8.00 This IP Agreement imposes personal obligations on Investor. Investor will not assign to any Third Party any rights under this IP

Investor’s rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements shall be freely assignable by Investor to any Person.

or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.

failure of the Parties to agree to enter into mediation or agree to any settlement proposed by the mediator, within sixty (60) days after the Escalation
to Mediation Date, either the Company or the Holder may file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Article 18.04.

cooperate with the disclosing party to minimize the extent and scope of such
disclosure.

any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement: (a) to any

2.1 OVERVIEW.  As set forth herein, 2TheMart will promote
Services to its auction users (buyers and sellers),

Mechanism working with 2TheMart to make
Services available seamlessly to Customers.
Unless otherwise specified, each party shall
be responsible for all development, hosting
and other costs associated with the pages
resident on their servers and all emails to
users they send.
2.2 INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT.
The parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine
the initial operation of the Information
Transfer Mechanism and to describe such
operation and development fees, in a
statement of work (""SOW"").  Each party shall
make available sufficient and qualified
engineers to negotiate the SOW.  No SOW
shall be binding on the parties unless
mutually approved by both parties.  In the
event that the parties are unable to agree
to an SOW within 2 months following the
Effective Date, either party may, in its
sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by
providing written notice.
Once approved, the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to
diligently implement their respective
obligations under the SOW.  Upon completion
of its duties under the SOW, a party shall
notify the other party and provide the other
party with the opportunity to test and
evaluate its work. i-Escrow shall make
available the Shadow Site for such testing
in a timely manner. Each party shall
reasonably cooperate with the other party in
effectuating their respective duties under
the SOW.  The Information Transfer Mechanism
shall not go live until its operation has
been approved (""Approval Date"") by both
parties, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld.
2.3 LAUNCH TIMING.  Each party shall use good faith
and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the
Co-Branded Pages and the Information
Transfer Mechanism.  In the event that,
after using such efforts, the Launch Date
has not occurred within 4 months following
the Effective Date, either party may
terminate this Agreement by providing
written notice.  If
only one party has used good faith and reasonable development
efforts, only that party may exercise the
foregoing right to terminate.
2.4 RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS.  i-Escrow may place
banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site
upon prior written approval of 2TheMart,
which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart.  All
advertising revenue arising from the banner ads shall be
solely i-Escrow's.  i-Escrow shall not run
banner advertisements on the Co-Branded Site
for any of 2TheMart's competitors. 2TheMart
shall provide in writing, a list of companies they would
like to exclude, including every time
they wish to change this list.
2.5 SERVICE PERFORMANCE OF INFORMATION TRANSFER
MECHANISM.  The parties each shall in good faith work to
provide reasonable service levels with respect to the
operation of the portions of the Information Transfer
Mechanism in their control.
Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/19992.6 PROGRAM REVIEW MEETINGS.  The parties shall meet, at
least once per month either in person, or by telephone, to
coordinate the implementation of this agreement over time.
3. PROMOTION.
After Launch Date, 2TheMart will widely promote the Services:
(a) To every seller and high bidder through means
including, but not limited to, end of auction
emails containing links, such that, it shall be
possible for the buyer or seller to initiate a
Transaction Inquiry with i-Escrow, without
having to re-enter all their personal or
transaction related information.
(b)  By adding links to Co-Branded Site in FAQ
section of 2TheMart auctions.
(c) By adding links to Co-Branded Site on the
seller listing pages of 2TheMart auctions.

all auction item pages and bidding pages to
educate bidders about i-Escrow. 2TheMart
may use the ""Escrow Services Description"" attached
in Exhibit A for creating such a page.
5. PAYMENT.
5.1 ADVERTISING FEES.  After the Launch Date,
i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based
on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising
fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry
amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by
the amount of the average Transaction from
all Customers in the preceding quarter. The
formula for arriving at the per Transaction
Inquiry amount may be revised from time to
time during the term of this Agreement to
reflect present market conditions (""the
Adjusted Rate""), but only by mutual
consent of the parties after good faith discussions.
The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an
addendum to this Agreement.
5.2 REPORTING.  Within two (2) weeks following the
end of each calendar quarter, i-Escrow shall provide
to 2TheMart a report, describing for each quarter: the
number of new registrations through the
Co-Branded Pages; the number of Transaction
Inquiries from Customers; the total number
of Transactions from such inquiries; the
total dollar value of the Transactions.
5.3 AUDIT RIGHTS. i-Escrow shall keep for one (1) year proper
records and books of account relating to the
computation of advertising payments owed to
2TheMart (including, as appropriate, the
computation of the size of average
Transaction).  Once every twelve (12)
months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect
and audit such records to verify reports.
Any such inspection will be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with i-Escrow's business activities and with
no less than fifteen (15) days notice.
i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any
overdue payments disclosed by the audit.
Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's
expense; however, if the audit reveals

(10%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow
shall immediately pay all cost of such
audit.

Successful completion of a transaction involves exchange of merchandise
with payment. The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they
thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she

seller by writing a check.  A typical escrow transaction:
When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to
i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow   you go
through the following steps to complete your transaction.
1.   Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the
merchandise along with email address of the other party.
2.   The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an
acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction.
3.   Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the
buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means.
4.   i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting
them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer.
5.   The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment.
6.   The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise.
7.   i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.

SCHEDULE  A 
(Attached  to and made a part of the Celebrity Endorsement Agreement  
dated March  14, 2012 by and between Bizzingo, Inc. and  
Joseph Theismann)  
  
I 
Background  
  
Bizzingo expects to populate  its Network with Activated Users (as defined herein) through two distinct methods.  
  
Method  1. 
(a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business  information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business 
name and address,  telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with 
specific  groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  
information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information  for a 
specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective  user (“Seeded Profile ”). As of 
the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers  and associations to provide the basic business information for over 
6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo.  For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an 
“Activated User. ” 
  
(b). In order to activate a  Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the 
Network,  and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim  the Seeded 
Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence  has been completed by a 
user, that user will be deemed to be an “Activated User ” and the Network will identify that  user as an Activated User.  
  
Method  2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will  be deemed an 
Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an “Activated User. ” 
  
II 
Royalty  and Initial Bonus  
  
1. Royalty . The Royalty  payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further 
described herein)  for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty 
Period  during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per  Activated 
User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and  1,500,000 Activated Users, 
respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty  Period and an additional 1,000,000 common 
stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant  shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of 
common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term  of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The 
form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A -l and  shall be referred to as the “Royalty Warrant .""

Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012  
2. Initial Bonus . Concurrent  with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to 
purchase 1,000,000  shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant  is 
attached hereto as Schedule A -II and shall be referred to as the “Bonus Warrant ."" 
  
3. Restrictive Legend . The restricted legend for purposes of any certificate representing the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant,  and the stock 
certificate for shares underlying the Royalty Warrant or Bonus Warrant is as follows:  
   
The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United  States Securities Act of 1933,  as amended (the ""Act"") or 
any state securities law. These  shares have been acquired for investment and may not  be offered for sale, hypothecated,  sold or transferred, nor 
will any assignee or transferee thereof be recognized by the  Company as having any interest in such shares, in the absence of(i) an effective 
registration  statement with respect to  the shares under the Act, and any other applicable state law, or (ii)  an opinion of counsel satisfactory to 
the Company  that such shares will be offered for sale,  hypothecated, sold or transferred only in a transaction which is exempt under  or is  
otherwise in compliance with the applicable securities laws.

Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012","The law that is closest to this contract is the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which has been adopted by many states in the United States. The UTSA provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of trade secrets and confidential information.","The UTSA defines a trade secret as information that is not generally known or readily ascertainable by others, and that derives economic value from being kept secret. It also provides that a trade secret may be a formula, pattern, or other type of information that is not generally known and that is used to derive economic value.

The contract at issue appears to be a celebrity endorsement agreement between Bizzingo, Inc. and Joseph Theismann. The agreement grants Theismann a royalty for each activated user of Bizzingo's network, which derives from confidential information that Bizzingo has acquired to populate its network. The agreement also includes a confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement, which is similar to those found in trade secret agreements."

The following provisions are included as part of this contract:
MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY.  This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society
becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will
be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in
cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged
as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.
MEMBERSHIP.  The person(s) named as the Insured(s) or the Annuitant(s) is a benefit member of the Society. Rights and privileges of
membership are set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges are separate from the ownership
of this contract.
DIVIDENDS.  Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract’s share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect
this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.
DIVIDEND OPTIONS.  If dividends are credited after premiums can no longer be paid under this contract, dividends will be paid in cash.
Otherwise, dividends will be applied under the Payment of Premium option unless the Cash option has been chosen in writing.

**********************************************************************************************
EXHIBIT A
A. PURPOSE OF APPLICATION SYSTEM.
To create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting
platform.
The Platform is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non-
professional betting market.
A landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices.
Developer will publish the app in Apple Store / Google Play Store with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be
uploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client.
The applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other
sports betting platforms.
The app will be developed under the following considerations:
● Native iOS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment.
● Native JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+
● Ruby On Rails Backend + PostgreSQL + Rest API
● HTML5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap
Core Platform
The Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact
with a platform for free in order to win real money.
Our primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players. We target a more general demographic that is much more general and includes
more of the female population.
Our games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from
push notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 – 4 times per month. Because the format doesn’t change,
we can run games nightly for NBA to NHL, NFL to individual events such as the Oscars, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as
Soccer and Nascar.
Games and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. Api’s Are plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual
option to allow customs events that can be run through the platform.
Business model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant
amounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are
more top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10.
Initially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors
will pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their
product/company.
8 │ Page
Source: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/2020Eventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting.
Monetization
We will initially fund the first month of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After the first month we will have enough users to
begin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising.
B. SERVICES.
The Developer will develop the mobile application based on the Client’s specifications, will assist the Client in acquiring corporate sponsors and

7.  CUSTOMER INFORMATION
Any and all customer data that is collected from the Co-Branded Site shall be
collected and used in accordance with Canadian federal and provincial laws and
U.S. Federal and State laws and both MediaLinx and HCI privacy guidelines and
MediaLinx and HCI shall each own an undivided interest in such data. MediaLinx
will not have access to the HCI Personal Health Records (being the longitudinal

during or after the Term of this Agreement. During the Term of this Agreement
and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, MediaLinx shall not use or

products that compete with those that reside on the Co-Branded Site. In other
instances, MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data
collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above.
In addition to the foregoing, HCI shall ensure that the Co-Branded Site is
integrated into the Sympatico site-wide registry in order for users to have a
single login access for all Sympatico.ca and Sympatico co-branded web sites.
8.  PAGE VIEWS
Both MediaLinx and HCI shall be entitled to count the page views on the Co-
Branded Site. In the event that it becomes necessary to have only one party
count the number of page views on the Co-Branded Site, due to third party
reporting, regulatory and/or legal requirements, HCI shall be entitled to count
one hundred percent (100%) of the content page views of the Co-Branded Site and
MLX shall be entitled to count one hundred percent (100%) of the HealthyWay

During the Term of the Agreement, and subject to the following requirements
respecting Canadian content levels as set out in paragraphs 3(f), (g) and (h),
HCI shall be the exclusive health content partner in the health section of the
Sympatico web site, provided however, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent MediaLinx from entering into an agreement with other parties for: i) a
health based web directory; or ii) other health related content whose content
does not compete with the content contained on the Co-Branded Site; which in no
event shall receive no more than one fifth (1/5th) of the promotion and which
shall constitute no more than one fifth (1/5th) of the total health related
content which resides on the home page of the Sympatico Health section. In the
event that MediaLinx obtains a web guide from a third party, MediaLinx and HCI
shall discuss how to present both web guides to the user, and make best effort
to agree to the kind of experience that the user shall have when utilizing the
new web guide. If, at any time during the Term of this Agreement, HCI fails to
meet the content requirements set out in paragraphs 3(f), (g) and (h), HCI shall
no longer be entitled to be the exclusive health content partner in the health
section of the Sympatico web site. HCI shall not either directly or indirectly
license or deliver content to or carry on or be engaged with any other Canadian
portal web site, being a Web site which aggregates and markets a variety of
content directed to multiple communities of interest and which offers products,

7.   CONFIDENTIALITY
     7.1. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS. Except as permitted elsewhere under this
Agreement, each party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to
receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other party in
confidence and (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third
parties, provided, the receiving party may disclose such Confidential
Information to its employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know
such information for purposes of carrying out the terms of this Agreement.
Neither party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information
of the other party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under
this Agreement. The parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to
ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this
provision. As used herein, ""Reasonable Steps"" means at least the same degree of
care that the
                                      8
receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no
event, not less than reasonable care.

that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving
party; (b) was already known to the receiving party at the time it was disclosed
to the receiving party, as evidenced by records of the receiving party; (c) is
independently developed by employees of the receiving party who had no knowledge
of or access to such information, as evidenced by records of the receiving
party; (d) is received from a third party who is under no obligation of

the confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 7   [CONFIDENTIALITY]  shall survive
termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.
     7.4. INJUNCTION. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of
this Article 7   [CONFIDENTIALITY]  are reasonable and necessary to protect the other party's
interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of
this Article 7   [CONFIDENTIALITY]  may result in irreparable harm to such other party, and that the
remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of
any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 7   [CONFIDENTIALITY]  by a party
hereto, the other party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law,
in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent
injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from engaging in and/or
continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 7   [CONFIDENTIALITY] , without
posting a bond or other security.
     7.5. PUBLICITY. Neither party will originate any press release concerning

soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, VerticalNet and
Impresse shall jointly issue a press release with respect to entering into this
Agreement.
     7.6. USER DATA . Impresse shall provide VerticalNet with User Data on each
User that submits information through the Co-Branded Site by sending an email
with such information to an email address designated by VerticalNet at the time

                              CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT
This Agreement is made this 21st day of January 2003  by and between Lucent
Technologies Inc. , a Delaware corporation having a principal place of business
at 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill , New Jersey 07974 (""Lucent"") and mPhase
Technologies Inc., a New Jersey corporation located at 587 Connecticut Avenue,
Norwalk, Connecticut 068545 (""mPhase"") (each individually, ""a Party"" and,
collectively, ""the Parties""}.
WHEREAS, mPhase wishes to use the Lucent Technologies name and Logo and the
slogan TECHNOLOGY BY LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES on printed circuit boards, product
packaging and in printed marketing materials (""Approved Uses"") in connection
with its multi-access product (the ""Goods"") and Lucent wishes to permit mPhase
to do so.
NOW THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:
1.       mPhase may apply only the exact logo shown on Schedule A of this
         Agreement (the ""Lucent Co-Branding Logo""} in Approved Uses for mPhase's
         Goods.
2.       mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of
         this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and
         specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent
         Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be
         updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well
         as the guidelines provided herein.
3.       In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the
         sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the
         mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT
         TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written
         notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.
4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo
         nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING
         DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by
         mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.
5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar
         to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent's marks LUCENT, LUCENT
         TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so
         shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this
         Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.
6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in
         the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the
         subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.
7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.
         mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the
         Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current
         quality of their Goods.
8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at
         the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in
         writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.
9.       mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the
         Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and
         approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to
         be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
10.      In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the
         Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase
         agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent's
         expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third
Source: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003         parties. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to
         require Lucent to enforce any rights against third parties or to
         restrict Lucent's rights to license or consent to such third parties'
         use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or any other Lucent marks.
11.      The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall
         continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to
         annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual
         expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate
         the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least
         thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.
12.      Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use
         of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall
         have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold
         prior to the date of such termination.
                                      -2-

o  The 2-logos of each company can never be combined to form a compositE logo

o  Our Logo must always maintain a staging of 1/2 the diameter of the Innovation
   Ring of clearspace.
o  The Lucent Logo may be reproduced in black or with the Innovation Ring in
   Lucent Red with black type.
o  The Lucent co-branding Art shown in Schedule A above may not be altered in
   any way from the form in which it is provided to mPhase by Lucent

   initial use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo be reviewed individually prior to
   implementation. Although mPhase may receive Co-branding approval for one
   application, it has not been granted 'blanket use' of the Co-Branding Logo or
   the Lucent Marks on all other applications.

To maintain a consistent user experience, any theglobe member should not need to
separately log in to the Service or the Co-Branded Pages .  The only login or
registration that should be required to access the Service or the Co-Branded
Pages is theglobe Site 's login or registration.  Because Boxlot hosts the
Service and the Co-Branded Pages , theglobe will pass to Boxlot information about
each User accessing the Service or the Co-Branded Pages  as described below:
 .    Accounts will be created for each User via a one-time ""welcome"" page
     (hosted by theglobe) when the User tries to access the portion of the
     Service requiring such registration for the first time.
 .    The ""welcome"" page will include registration fields for any information
     about the User needed to use the Service but not currently in theglobe's
     database.
 .    The ""welcome"" page will include a ""Privacy Policy"" informing the User that
     their data is being passed to a third party (Boxlot) in order to use the
     Services.
 .    Any additional required User information is collected and entered into
     theglobe's database. Then, the required User information is sent to Boxlot
     all at once to create the new account. theglobe will include the User's
     ""username"" and ""UserID#"" in the data passed to Boxlot.
Additional notes on account creation:
 .    The User will only see the ""Welcome"" page until they consent to the privacy
     policy and enter any required information. This page will not appear after
     the User completes the initial account creation process.
 .    Account information stored on Boxlot's servers in connection to the Service
     will need to be kept in parity with theglobe. To do so, the parties shall
     work together to implement a mechanism for updating information on Boxlot's
     servers when User information changes on theglobe Site .
 .    The technology used to pass the data to Boxlot for account creation and
     ongoing account updates will be determined jointly by Boxlot and theglobe.
 .    The UserID# theglobe passes to Boxlot during account creation will be
     stored by Boxlot in association with each User. This UserID# is necessary
     to link individual user reporting and individual account updates between
     Boxlot and theglobe on an ongoing basis.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in

1. Confidentiality; Non-competition; Non-solicitation .
(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller can show that such information: (i) is generally available to and
known by the public through no fault of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by such Seller,
any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to
disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing
and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that
such Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded such information.
2(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the “ Non-
Compete Period ”), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer’s capital stock or any other interests in Buyer,
directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: ( i) own, manage, operate or control any
business which competes with any Combined Business or ( ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged
in any Combined Business; provided , however  that nothing in this Agreement shall:
(i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent
collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged;
(ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller’s business as conducted on the Effective Date
and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and
(iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired
business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar
months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business.
Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term “ control ” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise.
(c) Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any
businesses involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined Business from any entity on Schedule 1  hereto.
(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the
“Non-Solicit Period ”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined
Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the
Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of
Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their
respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by
means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former
3employees of the Combined Business; provided , however , that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the
Non-Solicit Period.
(e) It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in this Section 1  shall be enforced to the greatest extent (but to
no greater extent) in time, area and degree of participation as is permitted by the Law of that jurisdiction whose Law is applicable to any acts
allegedly in breach of such covenants. To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1  shall be construed to extend in
time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants
contained in this Section 1  are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1  to govern competition by
the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1  shall be governed by and construed
according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that
best gives them effect.

California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any
provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.

California law.
 8.You must sign a general release if you renew or transfer your franchise. California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your
rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516). Business and Professions Code
